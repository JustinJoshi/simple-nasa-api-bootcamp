This was fun! I think I did well but it could use some styling

Nasa picture of the day api!

How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used NASA picture of the day API to get pictures for any given date! I setup a date input in my HTML to allow users to enter the date. Then using JavaScript I got the value from the input. After grabbing the value I read the nasa picture of the day documentation to find out where to put my api key, and date search parameter. I inserted the date into my url. I setup a fetch request for the url and inserted the photo or image into the dom. The project required some conditional logic to make sure if a video is displayed it inserts an iframe instead of an image! 


Optimizations

(optional)

There are some thing I could have done better. I think the project could use a bit better styling to be presentable. My main priotity though was getting it working first and refactoring later if I have more time. 

Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot about reading doucmentation and how to find exactly what you need from it
