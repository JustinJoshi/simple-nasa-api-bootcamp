nasa api


How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used the nasa picture of the day api to fetch a picture for every day. I used a date input to allow the user to enter a date and used that date to interact with the nasa api url and get the picture for that date. If there was a video. i put some simple conditional logic to insert an iframe

Optimizations

make it prettier

Lessons Learned:

i learned how to insert an iframe, i normally have not worked with them before.
